# Decadeclock
Decadal Clock (Name to be changed?)
is for my LMU CMSI 402 and Advanced Multimedia Senior capstone. This project will be a creative coding project that utlized both works of code in an art form and showing multimedia art within the tech field. 

The application being created by Cherrell Finister is Decadal Clock, a interactive and digital storytelling application. Decadal Clock allows users to select different time periods (decades) and explore the style and the most popular shows, movies, fashion, and trends during specific decades based on which one the user selects.  This application is a mix of both arts of coding and multimedia software to have an engaging interactive user experience, as well as teaching the user about select decades along the way.
