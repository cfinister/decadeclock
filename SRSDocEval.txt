This is a good start, and I can see that there are a lot of things you have
thought through.

You can ALWAYS specify more.  Try to think in terms of "if someone else
were to code this project, what would they need to know about the way it
operates?  What information could I provide them so they can be successful
in the implementation?

You have the language right, but there just isn't enough detail here to
actually start designing and coding the project, from an engineering
perspective.  For example, there are LOTS of things that can be stated
about what will show up on the page you mention in 3.2.1.9, and you should
list the various options that are referenced in 3.2.1.7 using a "will"
statement under the requirement.

Also, double-check your numbering to make sure it's sequential.

Finally, specify not just that an item will be used, but specify what it
will be used *FOR*.  For example, you say:

3.2.1.2 The client shall use HTML.

What will HTML be used *FOR*?  will that be on a browser or on the phone?
What adaptations will be made for different size phones?  Will the app
rotate when the phone does and change from portrait to landscape?

...and so on.

Otherwise, nice work!

So far for the semester:
Proposal:      5.0  out of  5.0  points
Requirements: 14.0  out of 15.0  points
Homework 1:    3.34 out of  3.34 points
Homework 2:    3.34 out of  3.34 points
Particip.:     1.5  out of  1.5  points
              27.18 out of 28.18 points = 96.45% which is an A

Keep it up!
